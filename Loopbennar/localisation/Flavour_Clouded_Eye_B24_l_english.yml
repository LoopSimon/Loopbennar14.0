Upon turning eighteen, she managed to become the chieftain of the Oakbreaker clan after her father, mother, and older brother were murdered by Korgus. She took her clan to fight against the Greentide as she just wanted to secure a home for the orcs, not destroy the humans.\n\nArosha has since become an icon among the orcish people. She guided us away from Korgus and instead guided us to a new future. As chieftain of the Clouded Eye clan, she took lessons from the humans and combined it with orcish traditions. We've built a mint, built a bureaucracy, defeated our rivals, harnessed the power of the Clouded Eye, and began the long process to start being seen as equals to humans. As the queen of our new kingdom, she ensured that the Ozarm'chadash was reformed from a battle to the death to instead being a nonlethal contest of merit.\n\nMany rulers may come and go, but Arosha Oakbreaker will remain in our cultural memory forever."

Children of the last ruler have a nonlethal Ozarm'chadash to determine who will lead, going through contests of strength and wit.

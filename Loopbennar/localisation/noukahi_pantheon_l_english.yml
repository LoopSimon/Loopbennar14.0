 noukahi_pantheon_religion_desc:0 "The Nouakahi Pantheon is a loosely connected collection of stories concerning heroic figures to the Vurebindu and Irsukuba people of Horashesh. The religion borrows heavily from neighbouring Fangaula, Nakavy Avo, and Khetist myths, meaning there are very few unifying themes. Instead each tale has different teachings and meanings, often varying depending on the person telling the story."

 HOLY_SITE_5863_DESC:0 "The shattered spire at Lake Kuiziva is so obviously not of this world, and many tales mythologising its true origins exist. For the people of Fangaula, it stood as the furthest point of their once mighty empire, and is said to be a bridge to the moon and a spirits final resting spot. For the people of Horashesh, it was where the warlord Kui announced his divinity. Legend says the spire started to sparkle with the light of the stars as he spoke, proving his status as the god's chosen."
 HOLY_SITE_6599_DESC:0 "In defence of the Vurebindu people, the creator Zuvanofa slayed the king of the genies in battle. However, he was wounded in the process. His consort, Noromhanda, took him to the Temple of Lel to heal, summoning seahorses to help bandage his wounds. As with many of the stories in the Noukahi Pantheon, there’s likely a grain of truth behind centuries of myth, as variations of this story also exist in the Nakavy Avo religion. The Temple of Lel is very real though. It still stands in the centre of Lelanán today, its walls adorned with seahorse mosaics."
 HOLY_SITE_5808_DESC:0 "The volcano Junansuar is home to a former Efreeti palace which has been transformed into a monastery dedicated to the divine blast kiln Mojobaa. Deep within the volcano, legends say Mojobaa forges weapons and tools in a divine workshop to combat God’s and creation’s enemies. Monks known for their exceptional blacksmithing skills tend the holy site, crafting powerful ironwood steel weapons imbued with elemental magic."
 HOLY_SITE_5941_DESC:0 "Lizardfolk are the ancient enemy for the people of Horashesh. Here before Zuvanofa created the world, they are considered an eternal threat to humanity. But that does not mean there is no respect for their culture and civilization. When the Iksilshebe warlord Nyokyora pushed deep into the lizardfolk jungle, his fellow warriors came back speaking in awed tones about the cities they uncovered. In the centre of the great city of Nahzni stood a circle of spires, each almost as large as the Kuiika Gamyi, appearing as though they were hewn from the stars themselves."
 HOLY_SITE_6063_DESC:0 "The first humans to cross the Salahad into Noukahi were led by Ardim, the chosen hero of Zuvanofa. She took them on a great procession across desert, mountain, swamp, and sea, until they landed at Ardim Qarast. There, she founded a great civilisation that stood for millenia, until it was buried by sand and sea. Variations of this story can be found all across Sarhal, although most historians scoff at the idea it could be real. To find this mythical city would upend our understanding of history."
 HOLY_SITE_5481_DESC:0 "Centuries of Kheteratan rule has its impact on one's faith. Certain figures cross religions if their stories are compelling enough, for there is nothing those following the Noukahi Pantheon love more than a good story. That is how Niramhat came to be. In Khetism she is Nirakhet, mother of Elikhet, whose tears pooled at Lake Nirakhet and became the enchanted river of The Sorrow. In the Noukahi Pantheon she is Niramhat, the All-Queen, and husband of Zuvanofa. But the tale of her tears creating The Sorrow is told across both faiths, making Lake Nirakhet a sacred place for both religions."
 HOLY_SITE_6690_DESC:0 "The Echenka are long-lost brethren of the Irsukuba people who never migrated to Horashesh. Instead they lived in the Rakkazi Highlands, on the outskirts of what was once their lush and green homeland: The Shadow Swamp. The legend amongst the Irsukubu people is that the great hag Hireet Gloomweaver offered the queen of the Echenka, Lama Kerac, the ability to revive her recently deceased husband. The spell worked, but in returning color to her husband, the Queen’s body was cursed. Everywhere she stood drained color from the land itself. In an attempt to contain the shadow's spread, she nailed herself to the Shadowroot Matriarch where she supposedly still resides. While the tale has many meanings to the Irsukuba people, the main message is quite simple: Never make a deal with the hags."

noukahi_pantheon.3.t:0 "yay! we're at gamyi!"
noukahi_pantheon.3.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] crests one last hill, a vivid scene unfolds before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]: to the south, Lake Kuiziva stretches out to the horizon, its placid surface dancing with the light of the setting sun; to the north, the rolling hills of the Kuiika countryside rise gently from the coastal flats, shimmering gold in the light breeze; and ahead the object of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s long pilgrimage looms, impossibly tall, a gleaming pillar of light against the deepening mauve of the oncoming night: the Kuiika Gamyi.\n\nWith the setting sun behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis], [Root.Monarch.GetName] continues towards the spire. To either side of the coastal road, a profusion of graves and memorials stand - some new, some weathered almost beyond recognition - solemn reminders of the countless battles fought here over the millennia. Ahead, a respectable city clings to the base of the great structure, toylike in comparison. Throngs of pilgrims crowd the streets; merchants hawk their wares. [Root.Monarch.GetName] pays them no mind, transfixed by the looming tower. Belly lurching with vertigo, they press on through the crowd.\n\nAt last they stand before the Gamyi, and, gingerly, rest a palm upon its featureless surface. At first, nothing: a twinge of fear. Then, everything at once: the cosmos flowing through their veins, a kaleidoscope of ages past. Electric. Terrifying. Then, peace. An insight gained. A gift bestowed. With a sense of fullness, [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns about, ready for the long trek home."
noukahi_pantheon.3.a:0 "the bois are gonna fight good tonight"

noukahi_pantheon.4.t:0 "Lelanán!"
noukahi_pantheon.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] steps ashore to a cacophony of crying gulls, before setting off into the bustling port city of Lelanán. The sights and sounds are overwhelming in their variety and intensity, and it takes all of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s concentration just to stay the course toward the city’s namesake attraction, following the Pilgrim’s Road as it winds its way like a river through the chaotic, colourful, organic city.\n\nThe midday gongs ring as [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally stands before the Temple of Lel. It is surprisingly humble for its fame, and very much of its city in terms of architecture: whitewash walls, a tiered roof topped with an onion dome, bas reliefs depicting marine life banding the exterior. At the behest of a low-ranked halfling priestess, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is ushered in.\n\nThe air is cool within, and laced with a refreshing hint of ozone. Mosaics featuring sea horses, merfolk, araizary and other sea creatures adorn the walls. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is shown into the heart of the temple, a circular room with a perfect half-sphere pool of crystal-clear water at its centre. Stepping forward, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gingerly sets one foot upon the pool: the surface tension does not break. Cautiously, [Root.Monarch.GetName] assumes a meditative pose and tries to calm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind. Imperceptibly, a feeling of peace descends. Minutes pass, hours, until time loses its meaning. When [Root.Monarch.GetName] wakes, it is dark out. Drenched in Lel’s serenity, the night holds no menace. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sighs in contentment, and begins the journey home."
